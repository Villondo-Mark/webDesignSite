    <h2>Lakeside Ballerina Animation Project Featuring Music from Anastasia (1997)</h2>

    allowfullscreen></iframe><div><p>This one was actually one of my favorite projects. This project was done to show 
      proficiency with Adobe AfterEffects, and we were allowed to take a previous project and incorporate it into this 
      new animation project. I immediately knew that I wanted to take this previous piece, originally a sticker,
     and turn it into something special. I already had it in mind before, but this opportunity came and I decided that
     I might as well have fun with it. The music featured is a piano cover done by piano Youtuber Kyle Landry of the song 
    "Once Upon A December" in the move Anastasia (1997). I've always liked this song since I rediscovered both it and the 
  movie years ago, and was originally the inspiration for the sticker in the first place. I took each visual element and 
animated it with the idea of a music box in mind. This project recieved a passing grade as the final project for the class 
that it was presented in.</p></div><br><br>

      <p>This wsas a project done with InDesign. The goal was to create an interface to an application that would work 
        on two different devices. In the midst of the educational turmoil that was brewing as a result of the Covid-19 
      pandemic, educational apps in schooling and seen a major increase of usage for K-12 students. I decided that my goal 
    was relevant to the times and that it was worth giving it a shot. This was an interface made for tablet, but the one 
  featuring the desktop version can be found in the Behance link. Otherwise, the video above should tell you everything else 
that you need to know about it. I achieved completion of this project through repeated testing and redesigning, with the 
finished product recieving passing marks.

          <h2>Moby Dick Book Custom Book Covers Project</h2><img class="example" src="/images/Moby Dick Book Cover 3True.png"><div><p>Moby Dick Book Cover 1 (shown above)</p></div>
  <img class="example" src="/images/Moby Dick Book CoverTrue.png">
  <div><p>This was a set of pieces done for a graphic design class. One to feature typography, one to use any 
    visual style, and another to use photography. The last one can be seen in the link to the Behance page. I wanted to 
  create posters that reflected my idea of the book. For one, it was an old book. I decided that I would have one cover be 
  done with grain, simple shapes a bright, contrasting colors that, to me, felt reminiscent of older book covers from the 
80's. The other, featuring Typography, was done in a way that looked simple but conveyed some of the ideas of the book 
nonetheless. I took the idea of the titular creature, Moby Dick, an unbounded, larger than life beast that lurks below the 
surface of the waters, and applied it to the title with opacity and gradients to really capture those concepts. You can read 
the rest on Behance.</p></div><br><br>

    <div class="portfolioWork"><h2>Word Poster Project feat. Baskerville MNT Pro</h2><img class="example" 
      src="/images/Word Poster Final edited.png">
    <div><p>This was a project done in my Typography class. The goal was to create a poster featuring the 
      unique characteristics of a chosen type, in my case, Baskerville MT Pro. When I see this type, I see it's origins and 
      where it's been used. I imagine older books in the libraries of our schools and towns, yellowed with age, featuring 
      this type to deliver thoughts and ideas, reflecting a sense of wisdom lost to time. With this in mind, I chose the 
      colors that helped bring those thoughts to life. I composed it in a way that incorporated modern styles and tried to 
      bring it into the 21st century. The stained texture was taken in Photoshop and applied in order to reflect a 
      sense of age that often accompanied it in my thoughts. This project piece was given passing remarks upon it's 
      turning in.
