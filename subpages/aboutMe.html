  <p class="aboutMe"> Hello and salutations to all who would like to get to know me! My name is 
    Mark Villondo, and I'm a proud resident of the great state of New Jersey. I was born in New York, 
    graduated highschool in my hometown of Bergenfield, and went off to college at BYU-I where I 
    graduated with a degree in Web Design and Development. I love travel, games, cooking, and 
    spending time with friends. <br> Throughout the years, I've been honing my practical abilities 
    in order to deliver well-designed and visually appealing interfaces, building my skills through 
    Adobe programs (Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, etc.) learning HTML, CSS, 
    and with getting along with my teammates and coworkers to build trust and work better to achieve
   our goals. <br>I built this website myself, with all the coding, images, and designs being done 
   with my own two hands, to show you that what you see here is what I can give you should you need 
  my services. <br><br>I'm a friendly guy, I promise.</p>

    <h4>My Design Philosophy</h4>
    <p class="designPhilosphy">Throughout my years of study and panic, I've come to learn a couple 
      of things that have helped shape who I am today, things that reflect on my design work. For one, 
      the concept of balance has always been one that has existed in my work, even before I was aware 
      of it. This meticulousness has been a constant since I was a lad, but after recognizing it, I decided 
      to go ahead utlilize it as a skill.<br> For me, balance means several things coming together for a 
      single purpose. One can usually tell when something feels off, but I always try to take it a step 
      further by fixing it down to the pixel to the best of my abilities. Of course, this has caused me no 
      small amount of stress and has also been the bane of many a deadline. However, throughout all of this,
      I've found that, if one is able to find peace and calm through the chaos of trying to achieve balance,
      they will be able to see more, feel far more confident, and effectively perform better than they 
      initially believed they could.<br><br>It is this exact thing that I try to achieve with all my 
      projects. Peace of the internal space of one's spirit leads to peace of external space with one's 
      surroundings.
